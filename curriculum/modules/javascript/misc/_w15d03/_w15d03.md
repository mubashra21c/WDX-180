  The lecture code can be found [here](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/_w15d03/assets/code){:target="_blank"} _([Download link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/_w15d03/assets/code){:target="_blank"})_

  - **Study** the [Event Flow diagram](https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-flow-h2){:target="_blank"} (again) to understand what happens every single time an event is triggered.  

  - **Study and experiment** with the [code](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180/tree/main/curriculum/modules/javascript/misc/_w15d03/assets/code/events.part.01){:target="_blank"} that we’ve created during the first session.   

  - **Study and practice** some of the events we’ve covered and mentioned: *click, dblclick, contextmenu, mouseover.* If you find some other cool events, please share it!  

  - **Check** the MDN documentation on the [*addEventListener*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener){:target="_blank"}  

  - What about the `event` object properties? Make sure to find about all of them.

  - Explore the [visibilitychange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event){:target="_blank"} event.
