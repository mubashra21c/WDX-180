  </summary>

### Schedule

  - **Study the suggested material**

### Study Plan

  According to the [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum){:target="_blank"} website:

  > "Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve."



  In this module, we are going to explore one of the most common and popular project management frameworks. You will watch a [series of YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_PJn_AGUdkMhkAkPKIDBf6ShCgYUOs8Y){:target="_blank"} to familiarize yourself with the Scrum framework and the following related concepts, since chances are that one of the companies or teams you are going to work with will employ this framework:

  - Sprints
  - Sprint Planning 
  - Sprint Reviews
  - Ceremonies
  - Backlog
  - Stand-ups
  - Scrum Roles

  **Suggested material for study and practice:**

  - [1. Scrum Framework in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VvSyXaH31Y){:target="_blank"} (6min)
  - [2. Product Backlog Refinement in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POpCiEXOWkE){:target="_blank"} (5min)
  - [3. Sprint Planning in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LizzCzsJQg){:target="_blank"} (4min)
  - [4. Daily Scrum in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MARBZbCw9tA){:target="_blank"} (3min)
  - [5. Sprint Review in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-av0l_vbDs4){:target="_blank"} (2min)
  - [6. Sprint Retrospective in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZvHdN1Huo){:target="_blank"} (2min)
  - [7. Scrum In A Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_sAo93ASTU){:target="_blank"} (5min)

  - Read the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/){:target="_blank"} as "Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one." [Source](https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/){:target="_blank"}
